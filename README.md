# Leap Year
Simply put, a leap year is a year with an extra day—February 29—which is added nearly every 
four years to the calendar year.

## Why Are Leap Years Necessary?
Adding an extra day every four years keeps our calendar aligned correctly with the astronomical
seasons, since a year according to the Gregorian calendar (365 days) and a year according to 
Earth’s orbit around the Sun (approximately 365.25 days) are not the exact same length of time. 
Without this extra day, our calendar and the seasons would gradually get out of sync. 

Because of this extra day, a leap year has 366 days instead of 365. Additionally, a leap year 
does not end and begin on the same day of the week, as a non–leap year does.

### How Do You Know If It’s a Leap Year?
Generally, a leap year happens every four years, which, thankfully, is a fairly simple pattern 
to remember. However, there is a little more to it than that.

Here are the rules of leap years:

* A year may be a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4.
* Years that are divisible by 100 (century years such as 1900 or 2000) cannot be leap years 
unless they are  also divisible by 400. (For this reason, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 
were not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 were.)
